# TensorFlow-Hub-formation

A TensorFlow-Hub formation for graduate students attending the NLP course at Sogang University.  

This presentation introduces TensorFlow really quickly then goes through TensorFlow-Hub's modules by helping people understands the following questions : what is this library used for ? Why could it be useful in my NLP project ? and finally how to use them ?

An example of a sentiment classifier model trained on a large IMDB dataset thanks to a TensorFlow-Hub module is provided in order to have a better idea of how this library can be efficient.
